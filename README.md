# Custom-Navigation
My implementation of the sample code for an embedded custom transition 
from InvasiveCode https://www.invasivecode.com/weblog/custom-view-controller-transition?doing_wp_cron=1451331333.1416780948638916015625

This is part of my attempt to understand custom transitions and why it seems so difficult to unwind custom segues and transitions
